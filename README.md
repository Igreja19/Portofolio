Fábio Almeida's Project Portfolio
This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and academic journey in the TeSP course in Information Systems Programming at the Politécnico de Leiria.

This site acts as a visual gallery for my most relevant work, demonstrating my capabilities in web development (front-end and back-end) and mobile development (Android).

🚀 Featured Projects
This portfolio includes visual showcases for the following projects:

1. KeySardinha (Full E-commerce Platform)
A robust e-commerce system for selling digital game keys, developed in three components:

Front-Office (Web): The client-facing store with a game catalog, filters, shopping cart, and checkout system.

Back-Office (Web): The administrative panel for managing content, users, promotions, and digital keys, featuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Mobile App (Android): A native Java app allowing customers to browse the store, manage their favorites (with offline support via SQLite), and view their profile.

2. Emergency STS (Hospital Triage System)
A technological solution to digitize and optimize the hospital emergency room triage process, based on the Manchester Triage System.

Web Portal (Patient & Staff): The patient side allows for pre-triage form submission and real-time queue tracking. The staff side (Back-Office) is used by nurses and doctors to manage the queue, assign priorities, and record diagnoses.

Mobile App (Android): A native Java app with two distinct modes:

Patient Mode: To check their queue status, bracelet color, and estimated wait time.

Nurse Mode: To manage the patient list, assign triage bracelets, and view triage history.

3. O Cantinho (Web)
Cantinho dos Pulgentos it is a web application designed to adopt pets and find them loving homes. Built in PWC classes.

4. PAP / Final Project ()
My Professional Aptitude Project (PAP), CodeBetter, is an online code editor designed to facilitate programming and learning. Its main objective is to allow users to view, modify, and store their projects centrally in the cloud.
The platform's architecture is divided into:

Frontend: Includes the home page, login/register, the code editor, user profiles, and an open-source community section.

Backend: Responsible for all business logic, including authentication, user management, news management, and subscription plan management.

CodeBetter was designed as a tool for programming and observing projects in real-time, while also fostering learning through community sharing.
